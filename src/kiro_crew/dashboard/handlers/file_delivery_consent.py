"""Owner-gated dashboard endpoints for flagged-file delivery consent.

The ONLY writer of ``file_delivery_consent.json``. The store sits on the keystone
floor so an agent cannot write it with file tools or a shell form, and there is
deliberately no CLI verb -- a terminal command that records a grant on request is
a grant an automated caller can take, and its guard would have to key on an env
var an in-process agent can unset. That leaves exactly one door, and this module
is it.

Every verb, reads included, is refused to anyone but the dashboard OWNER. Three
callers had to be shut out and only the first is obvious:

* an AGENT: already blocked from the file itself by the keystone fence, but an
  app token declaring this route's permission would be the same door's second
  key, so the check is here too rather than relying on the fence alone.
* an APP token: an app could otherwise mint a grant with no human in the loop.
* an allowed MESSAGING user: a Slack allow-listed non-owner running
  ``!dashboard`` authenticates with ``app == ""``, so an app-only check would let
  them authorize delivery of the OWNER's secrets.

Reads are refused for their own reason: the response says which delivery
destinations the owner has blessed, which tells a caller where a flagged file
would land unrefused. ``is_owner_dashboard_request`` already encodes exactly the
rule needed (app present and empty, caller equal to ``owner_id`` or a local-owner
subject), so it is reused rather than re-derived.
