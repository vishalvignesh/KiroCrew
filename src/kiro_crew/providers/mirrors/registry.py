"""Which backend has a mirror, and — as a first-class entry — which has none.

The point of a registry rather than a lookup that returns ``None`` on a miss is
that **absence has to be a statement**. A backend with no entry here fails the
parity test; a backend that genuinely needs no projection says so, with its
reason, in :data:`NO_MIRROR`. That is the difference between "declared not to
need one" and "nobody got round to it", which is the distinction whose absence
let the same missing-tools defect ship twice.
