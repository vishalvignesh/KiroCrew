    Detects the failure this guards against — an immediate exit, e.g. EADDRINUSE
    from a port collision — while NOT paying the full grace window when the child
    is healthy. The old loop slept its entire ~1.6s budget on the happy path and
    broke only on death, so every app added ~1.6s of pure boot latency; with
    concurrent boot that was the single largest startup cost.

    The early exit is driven by POSITIVE evidence: once OUR OWN child owns the
    listening socket on *port*, it has completed the very bind whose failure this
    function exists to catch, so waiting longer cannot change the answer.

    Two things are deliberately NOT accepted as success:

    * **Elapsed liveness alone** — a child that crashes a few polls in (slow
      sandboxed interpreter, loaded host) would be mis-reported as started.
    * **Someone else's listener** — "the port is open" is not the same claim as
      "our child bound it". With a fixed manifest port, another app (or any
      unrelated process) can already hold it, and our child is then the one about
      to die of EADDRINUSE; treating that as survival would report a doomed pid as
      started and route two apps at one backend.

    Ownership accepts our pid OR any descendant of it, because the sandbox
    launcher execs the real server as a child. When ownership cannot be
    established at all (no port to observe, or no port->PID tool on the host), it
    degrades to polling the full budget exactly as before.

    The ownership probe shells out to lsof (~150ms), so it is gated behind a cheap
    loopback connect and is not run on every poll: the deadline below stays honest
    about wall-clock rather than adding the probe's cost to each interval, which
    would otherwise make the failure path take LONGER than the original budget.
