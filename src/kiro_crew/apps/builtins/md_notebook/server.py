"""Notes backend — git-backed markdown vaults for KiroCrew.

Ported from the app's Node backend. The gateway proxies
``/apps/md-notebook/api/*`` to this process, preserving the ``/api/`` prefix, so
the routes below are exactly the paths the UI calls.

State layout (overridable via ``MD_NOTEBOOK_HOME`` for tests):

    <home>/vaults.json      vault descriptors (no secrets)
    <home>/pat              GitHub token, chmod 0600
    <home>/vaults/<id>/     vaults this app cloned itself

Two kinds of vault: one this app cloned into ``<home>/vaults/``, and one
"attached" in place — a folder the user also edits with Obsidian, an editor, or
the git CLI. The attached case is why saves are guarded against concurrent
external edits and why the note listing is re-scanned rather than trusted.

    The rename can fail on Windows with `PermissionError` while another handle is
    open on the note -- routine for a vault the user also has open in an editor,
    and for the search indexer and AV scanner. Losing the save there is the user
    losing what they just typed, so the transient is retried.

    What is retried is the CHECK-AND-WRITE, never the rename alone. Retrying
    inside the rename would stretch the gap between the freshness check and the
    publish across the whole backoff, and an edit completing in that gap would be
    silently overwritten by the next attempt -- exactly what the `baseMtime`
    guard exists to prevent.

    **The lock policy depends on whether this save carries a freshness token**,
    because that is what decides whether a writer in the gap can be DETECTED:

    * ``baseMtime`` supplied -- the lock is released across the backoff. Another
      writer landing in the gap is not a problem to exclude: the next attempt
      re-runs the check, sees it, and answers 409. Releasing keeps a contended
      save from blocking an external-conflict resolution behind it.

    * no ``baseMtime`` (the API allows it, and the editor omits it when it has
      not read an mtime) -- ``_assert_note_is_fresh`` is a no-op, so a writer in
      the gap is INVISIBLE to every later attempt. Releasing the lock there let a
      contended save resurrect itself over a later save that had already been
      acknowledged with 200. The lock is therefore held across the backoff, which
      preserves exactly the serialization the un-retried code had: a same-note
      writer waits (at most the retry budget, ~450ms) rather than being
      overwritten afterwards.

      The lock orders API writers and nothing else, so it is only half the
      answer. An editor writing the file directly -- Obsidian, ``git pull``, a
      script -- never takes it, and republishing over that edit is undetectable
      after the fact. So the tokenless path derives its OWN baseline
      (``_observed_note_mtime`` before the first attempt) and revalidates
      against it before every RETRY: the same 409 ESTALE the guarded path
      answers, from a baseline the server sampled instead of one the client
      supplied. The first attempt never consults it -- overwriting the sampled
      state IS the save.

    Holding it is a coroutine suspension, not a blocked event loop, and it is
    per-note.

    Budget mirrors `atomic_write.replace_with_retry`, whose window this is.
