# Turn a Kiro Crew crash artifact into readable frames.
#
# The problem this closes: a macOS `.ips` report from a shipped build has
# `asi: null` and every frame symbol is a NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR GUESS, because the
# Electron Framework in a release build is stripped. Read literally, such a
# report implicates whatever exported symbol happens to sit below the crash
# address — which is how one main-process crash got filed against a component
# that never appeared in the actual call chain. Symbolizing is not a nicety
# here; unsymbolized, the stack is actively misleading.
#
# What was missing was never really the symbols. Electron publishes them with
# every release and keeps them forever, and a `.ips` even names the exact build
# it needs (`usedImages[].CFBundleShortVersionString` plus a Mach-O `uuid`).
# What was missing was the RECIPE: that these archives exist, which of the two
# formats matches which artifact, that `.ips` frame addresses are image-relative
# and have to be rebased before atos sees them, and that a dSYM from the wrong
# build fails SILENTLY — printing plausible, wrong frames rather than an error.
# This script is that recipe, and the UUID check below is what makes the silent
# failure loud.
#
#   .ips report   -> dSYM (Mach-O DWARF, ~1.4-1.7 GB) -> atos
#   .dmp minidump -> Breakpad .sym (~128-146 MB)      -> minidump_stackwalk
#
# Usage:
#   symbolize-crash.sh <crash-artifact> [--manifest <symbols-manifest.json>]
#                                       [--electron <version>] [--arch arm64|x64]
#
# A `.ips` needs no version argument: the report names its own. A `.dmp` does,
# because a minidump identifies modules by debug ID rather than by semver — pass
# `--manifest` (CI archives one beside each build's artifacts, see
# scripts/emit-symbols-manifest.mjs) or `--electron` if you know the version.
#
# Downloads are cached, because these run 128 MB to 1.7 GB per arch:

// The load address goes out as HEX. A .ips stores `base` as a decimal JSON
// number, and `atos -l` parses its argument as hex unconditionally — so passing
// the decimal digits through silently slides every address out of range and atos
// echoes the inputs back unresolved instead of erroring. That looks exactly like
// "the symbols do not cover these frames", which is the wrong conclusion to
// hand someone reading a crash.
