# Build the standalone KiroCrew desktop app end-to-end.
#
# Pipeline (uses the python-build-standalone approach):
#   1. Build the React dashboard (npm)         -> website/dist
#   2. Provision a python-build-standalone (PBS) interpreter via uv
#   3. pip-install kiro_crew + deps INTO the bundled interpreter
#   4. Stage the dashboard into the package's static dir
#   5. Prune caches/tests/unused stdlib to shrink the bundle
#   6. Package the desktop app with electron-builder -> DMG (mac) / AppImage (linux)
#
# The result is a double-clickable app that embeds the whole Python backend +
# dashboard — no system Python, pip, npm, or node required by the end user.
#
# PBS interpreters are self-contained
# and use @executable_path-relative dylib references, so the bundle is genuinely
# portable across machines without needing the exact same system Python version.
#
# ARCHITECTURE: on macOS this builds ONE universal .app/DMG by default: the
# Electron shell is lipo-merged (arm64 + x86_64) by electron-builder, and the
# backend — which cannot be lipo-merged (a whole PBS tree, not one binary) —
# ships as TWO complete trees (backend-dist/kirocrew-backend-arm64/ and
# .../kirocrew-backend-x64/), selected at launch by find-bin.js via
# process.arch. The x86_64 backend is built under Rosetta 2, so the universal
# build needs an Apple-Silicon host. Linux always builds host-arch only
# (AppImage). UNIVERSAL=0 forces a host-arch-only macOS build (faster local
# iteration, or the only option on an Intel Mac).
#
# Usage:
#   bash packaging/build-desktop.sh            # macOS: universal DMG · Linux: host arch
#   UNIVERSAL=0 bash packaging/...             # macOS: host-arch-only DMG
#   SKIP_FRONTEND=1 bash packaging/...         # reuse an already-staged dist
#   SKIP_ELECTRON=1 bash packaging/...         # stop after the backend binary

# NOTE ON THE APPLE-SILICON DECODER -- do NOT re-introduce a compressed payload.
#
# The arm64 imageio-ffmpeg executable ships as a PLAIN Mach-O under
# Contents/Resources, exactly like its x86_64 sibling, so the app signer signs it
# with Developer ID + hardened runtime + secure timestamp along with every other
# nested binary (packaging/signing/generate-manifest.py enumerates it).
#
# #6746 instead stored it as inert gzip data, to keep the bytes byte-identical to
# the pinned upstream wheel across signing. The Apple notary service DECOMPRESSES
# archive members and scans what is inside them, so that made notarization fail
# closed on the whole release (submission 3dbd3c7d, three `error` issues on
# .../binaries/ffmpeg-macos-aarch64-v7.1.gz/ffmpeg-macos-aarch64-v7.1: not signed
# with a valid Developer ID certificate / no secure timestamp / hardened runtime
# not enabled). The x86_64 copy of the same wheel, shipped raw in the same
# submission, drew no issue at all -- that is the working shape.
#
# The runtime consequence is handled in kiro_crew.transcribe: the packaged decoder
# is accepted either at the pinned upstream digest (local builds and the build gate
# below, which run BEFORE signing) or on a valid Developer ID signature from our
# team (the released app, whose bytes signing necessarily rewrote).

# Prove that the installed native wheel, audio decoder, and their transitive
# libraries can actually run from the pruned bundle. A successful pip resolution
# is not enough: an ABI mismatch or missing executable otherwise reaches every
# user as an unusable Download button. Model weights are deliberately not involved
# in this gate.
#
# THREE outcomes, not two, because the decoder answers two independent questions
# (see transcribe.PackagedDecoderProbe):
#
#   exit 0  everything loaded and ran
#   exit 1  the recogniser is broken, OR no decoder AUTHENTICATED -- a defect in
#           what we are about to publish, so the build stops
#   exit 2  the decoder authenticated but this HOST would not run it
#
# Exit 2 is a warning and not a failure, and that is the whole point of splitting
# them. Authenticity is a property of the artifact and is gated everywhere;
# executability is a property of the build machine. A build image missing an OS
# library the pinned executable load-time imports refuses it before its entry
# point runs -- Windows Server Core, which every CodeBuild Windows image is built
# on, ships no Video for Windows components and so cannot load an ffmpeg that
# imports AVICAP32.dll -- while the identical bytes run correctly on a user's
# machine. Blocking a release on that withholds a correct artifact because the
# machine that assembled it was not the machine that runs it.

# it as its own code, on every platform, with no ownership probe (see
# readExternallyManaged in website/electron/auto-update.js). A marker dropped
# beside the app after the build (`<resources>/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`) is the
# repackager affordance and stays gated on file provenance; that gate refuses
# every user-owned install and can never pass on Windows, which is why an
# edition bakes instead of dropping.
#
# The copy is validated as the JSON object the reader accepts -- string fields
# only, under the reader's 8 KiB read cap -- and the build FAILS on anything
# else: the reader treats a malformed marker as "managed, nothing to run", so a
# typo here would silently ship an app that can neither self-update nor be

      #    getWindowsInstallationDirName() falls back to the npm package name

      # registration and the shell reports that app as relocated or missing even
      # though its .exe is untouched.

      # main.js already claims at runtime via app.setAppUserModelId, so the
