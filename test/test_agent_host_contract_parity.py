"""Every known agent backend must have a column in the host contract.

`docs/system-specs/features/agent-host-contract.md` says what a backend must
supply to Crew *besides* speaking ACP, in nine buckets, one column per backend.
Its own New-provider checklist says "Silence is not an answer" -- and until this
gate existed, nothing enforced that.

Codex proved it.  It landed in ``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`` and in
``BASELINE_SELECTABLE_BACKENDS``, so a plain public build served sessions on it,
while appearing in none of the nine buckets.  The §5 failure the checklist
already described then recurred unchanged on it: no MCP projection, so none of
Crew's own control plane reaches a codex session.  A stronger sentence had
already been tried; this is the gate.

Scope, stated honestly: this asserts a column EXISTS, not that its cells are
true or even informative.  A column of "unknown" passes.  That is the limit of a
text gate -- it makes the omission visible, and a reviewer makes it answered.

What it does and does not check structurally, since a reader will assume more
than is here.  It DOES require each bucket's contract table to be the first
table under its heading, reject a second backend-shaped table in the same
bucket, verify the markdown rule row's width, resolve every Column-meaning row's
CONSTANT NAME against :mod:`kiro_crew.acp_backends` and confirm the documented
value matches the real one, and require bucket numbering to be consecutive from
1 and to reach at least 9.  It does NOT check heading titles, cell padding, or
prose -- a bucket renamed but still numbered passes.

Three attacks drove that list, all of which an earlier draft of this file
allowed: a decoy backend-shaped table placed before the real one (the parser
took the first and stopped looking), a continuation table further down the
bucket omitting a backend, and a fabricated ``ACP_BACKEND_FAKE = ""`` row
impersonating kiro-cli -- which worked because only the quoted value was read
and a set erases the alias.
