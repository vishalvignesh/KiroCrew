"""The orchestrator's first-stage config load must not run on the gateway loop.

``_stage_loop`` is async, but the first time it runs for a slot it has no
``OrchestrationTracker`` yet and builds one from the configured stage timeout.
That read goes through ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, which stats and reads
``config.json`` plus any ``config.local.json`` overlay, deep-merges them and runs
the full jsonschema validation — all synchronously, on the single event loop the
gateway shares with every other session.

Only the load crosses to a worker. The value is applied and the slot is read back
on the loop, so no live orchestration state is handed to another thread.

The hop is also the loop's FIRST suspension point, ahead of every stage check, so
both cancellation channels can now land while the worker runs, and the tests here
drive each through its real endpoint:

* **Plan Cancel** stops ``slot._orch_tracker``. The tracker is therefore
  published BEFORE the load rather than built from its result, so the press has
  the canonical thing to stop and the check afterwards is the same
  ``_orchestration_stopped`` every advancement gate already uses. Nothing reads
  the stage budget until a stage records its first round, so adjusting it once
  the load returns is safe.
* **Dashboard Stop** can fire AND fully resolve inside the await, leaving
  ``_stopping`` back at False, which is why the loop compares
  ``_stop_generation`` rather than re-reading the flag.

Abandoning the plan is not the same as abandoning the slot: a message the user
queued while the config loaded is held behind the ``_in_stage_execution`` guard,
and only the stage loop's own ``finally`` clears it and hands the queue on. The
abort therefore leaves through that ``finally`` like any other exit.
