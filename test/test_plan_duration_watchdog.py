"""A whole plan needs a duration ceiling, not just a per-stage one.

``OrchestratorConfig`` carried only ``stage_timeout_seconds``. That bounds ONE
stage, and a plan multiplies it: ten stages at the 30-minute default is a five-hour
unattended run with nothing to stop it (issue #1783). ``max_plan_duration_seconds``
is the ceiling for the run, checked at each stage boundary — not mid-turn, because
the running stage already has its own ceiling and cutting between stages leaves
every finished stage captured on disk and resumable.

One warning fires at ``PLAN_WARN_FRACTION`` of the budget so the user can
intervene before the cut rather than only learning of it afterwards, and it is
latched in the tracker so a long plan does not re-announce it at every boundary.
