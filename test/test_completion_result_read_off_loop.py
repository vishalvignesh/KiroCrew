"""Plan-completion stage-result reads must not run on the gateway event loop.

When ``_stage_loop`` finishes every stage it builds one final summary message,
and it does that by re-reading each captured stage-result file off disk. That is
a separate lifecycle boundary from the per-stage context build: it happens once,
after the loop, and the number of files it reads is the whole plan's stage count.

Only the filesystem work belongs off-loop. The paths come from
``tracker._stage_results``, which the loop mutates via ``record_stage_result``,
so they are snapshotted on the loop thread and only immutable data crosses into
the worker; the summary text, the slot append, and the broadcast stay on the loop.
