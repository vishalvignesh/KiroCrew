"""``session_pid`` must not depend on the ACP layer at import time.

``session_pid`` is the one agent-lifecycle concern the ACP layer still owns:
``acp/runtime.py`` and ``acp/client.py`` drive every track/untrack transition.
That direction is fine.  The reverse direction is not, and until recently
``session_pid.py`` imported ``kiro_crew.providers.base`` at module scope for a
single parameter annotation, which closed a real cycle::

    session_pid -> providers.base -> acp.types -> acp/__init__
                -> acp.runtime -> session_pid

The cycle was not theoretical.  Importing ``kiro_crew.session_pid`` as the
first ``kiro_crew`` module raised ``ImportError: cannot import name
'_track_pid' from partially initialized module``, so the module was only ever
importable because something else had already imported the ACP package first.
Four other leaves paid for it with ``LLMProvider = Any`` runtime stubs and
function-local imports carrying ``# circular import`` comments.

Note what the fix is NOT.  Moving the import under ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` closes
the cycle but is refused by ``scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py``, which counts
a type-only import as boundary knowledge by design and offers no opt-out marker.
The annotation was simply wrong: ``_sync_kill_provider`` reads three private
attributes through ``getattr(..., None)`` that the provider ABC does not declare,
so the parameter is ``object`` and the edge is gone rather than exempted.

These tests pin that, and they are the criterion for the cycle being closed.  A
module-scope import of ``kiro_crew.providers`` or ``kiro_crew.acp`` added back to
``session_pid.py`` fails them -- including one added lazily, since the second test
checks what the import actually loaded rather than what the source says.

Both run in a fresh interpreter on purpose.  Inside the pytest process the ACP
package is already in ``sys.modules``, so the cycle cannot be observed and an
in-process assertion would pass vacuously.  The child inserts this repository's
``src/`` at the front of ``sys.path`` rather than trusting ``PYTHONPATH``: an
editable install may point at a different checkout, and this test must measure
the tree it ships in.
