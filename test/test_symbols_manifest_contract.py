"""A desktop build must record WHICH Electron it was packaged against.

``website/electron/package.json`` pins a RANGE (``^43.x``), so two builds a
month apart can resolve to different Electron versions with nothing recording
which was which. That matters more than it sounds: symbolizing a crash against
the wrong Electron does not fail loudly. ``atos`` happily prints the nearest
neighbouring symbol for every frame, producing a stack that reads like a real
call chain and is not -- which is how one main-process crash got filed against a
component that never appeared in it.

``scripts/emit-symbols-manifest.mjs`` writes the resolved version plus the exact
symbol-archive names and URLs, and ``scripts/symbolize-crash.sh`` consumes it.
The three ways that plumbing silently rots are what this file pins:

1. The emit step running BEFORE the build, where ``node_modules/electron`` does
   not yet exist or still holds a previous resolution.
2. The manifest not being in the upload globs, so it is written and discarded.
3. The manifest reaching only the CI artifact, which expires in 14 days, while
   the crash reports it decodes arrive from released builds months later.

None of the three shows up as a red build -- the artifact, or the release, is
simply missing the one file that makes a future crash report readable.

A third way it rots is not silent but dangerous: the symbolizer TRUSTS the
manifest. It reads an asset name out of it and makes that a path under the
download cache, and reads a URL out of it and fetches that. A manifest arrives as
a downloaded CI artifact, so neither value is this script's own, and a name
carrying ``../`` would put attacker-chosen bytes on a writable host file. The
last group of tests runs the real script against hostile manifests.

The final group covers the other half of that trust problem: a ``.ips`` carries
its own uuid and slice, and the script must keep reading them even when the
caller supplies ``--electron`` -- otherwise the one check that makes a wrong-build
dSYM loud is silently switched off by an argument that looks like extra precision.

Offline: the static checks read the workflow YAML and the script source, and the
execution checks all exit before the script reaches the network -- the ``.ips``
runs by pre-seeding both cached slices, the manifest runs by failing their gate.

# legitimately assert with `--electron`; the other two are evidence about the
# report in hand and have no substitute. Parsing them was once gated on
# `--electron` being absent, so passing it left `REPORT_UUID` empty and silently
# disabled the dwarfdump gate -- the one check that turns a wrong-build dSYM into
# an error instead of a plausible, wrong stack.
#
# Both tests below run the real script and stop long before the network: the
# messages they assert on are printed while the report is being parsed, upstream
# of every tool and platform check.
