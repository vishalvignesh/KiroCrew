"""The shipped md-notebook backend can see its own state files (#8762).

``_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` bind-masks ``workspace/md-notebook/{pat,vaults.json,
settings.json}`` in every sandbox mode so the AGENT's spawned subprocesses
cannot read the GitHub token or rewrite the vault list. PR #7439 applied that
mask unconditionally — including to the md-notebook BACKEND, which is itself
spawned under the same sandbox (``apps/backend.py`` ``wrap_argv``) and OWNS
those files, so every attach/clone failed with EPERM.

These tests pin the carve-out: :func:`md_notebook_backend_state_paths` names
every masked spelling of exactly those three leaves, and passing them as
``extra_visible_dirs`` un-hides them in BOTH platform builders (Linux launcher
+ macOS seatbelt) without re-sealing them read-only and without weakening any
sibling mask entry. The spawn-site condition (shipped-builtin provenance only)
is pinned in ``test_app_backend.py``.
